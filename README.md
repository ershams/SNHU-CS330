How do I approach designing software?
My approach to designing software is to initially break the project down into smaller, executable parts and work on each part individually in order to build it piece-meal. This allows me to write reproducable code that I can later use to save time, and to understand where errors may arise. This approach to design will likely help me in the future as it will allow me to deliver partial projects to clients, which may easily be amended according to client needs.

How do I approach developing programs?
My strategy for developing my 3D scene was to initially create rudimentary shapes without worrying about scale, location, textures, or lighting. Once I was able to reliably produce the required shapes, I made sure that they were reusable since many elements in the project were repeated. This meant that I needed to properly understand the concepts of position along the x, y, and z axes. Finally, I added textures and lighting to the project. Because of this, I had multiple iterations of the project.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
While computational graphics may not be the field I plan on entering, this class has given me a basic understanding of how images are rendered. This may help me with my eventual goal of working in data analytics, as it may require understanding the similarities between different images.
